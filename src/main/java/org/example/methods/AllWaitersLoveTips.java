    /**
     All waiters love tips! One of them shared a secret rating system with me based on the tip amount left:

     terrible, if the amount is 0 UAH;
     poor, if the amount is between 0 and 10 UAH inclusive;
     good, if the amount is between 11 and 20 UAH inclusive;
     great, if the amount is between 21 and 50 UAH inclusive;
     excellent, if the amount is more than 50 UAH.

     To help guests find out the rating of their tip, we created the getTipsRating() method.
     Your task: implement getTipsRating() method so that it takes the tip amount and returns
     the corresponding rating from the list above.

     For example:
     getTipsRating(0);   // "terrible"
     getTipsRating(10);  // "poor"
     getTipsRating(19);  // "good"
     getTipsRating(51);  // "excellent"

     Hints:
     - method should accept int as a parameter
     - method should return correct string message: terrible, poor, good or excellent
       (not print the message, but return it)
     - call getTipsRating method inside the main method
     - put method call into System.out.println statement to see the result in console
     - use conditionals (if, else if, else etc.)
     - For a method definition use 'public static' keywords (we will learn them later).

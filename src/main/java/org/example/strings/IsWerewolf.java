     In this task, you'll work with string reversal and comparison.
     We've received information that werewolves might be dangerous to humans.
     We don't yet know why, but we can't ignore this warning. We need to identify werewolves as quickly as possible.
     Let's start by checking words and sentences.
     A word or sentence can be considered a "werewolf" if it reads the same forward and backward.
     Implement the isWerewolf() method to determine whether the given string target is a palindrome.

     Hints:
     - use StringBuilder's reverse() method.
     - Check if reversed string equals the normal string
     - If so - return true, otherwise return false

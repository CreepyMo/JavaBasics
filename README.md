## **How to Work on Homework**

Follow these steps to work on your homework tasks:

### **Step 1: Create a New Branch from `main`**
It's important to always work on a new branch for each homework task, so you donâ€™t interfere with the main branch. To create a new branch:

1. Ensure you're on the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes from the remote `main` branch (to stay up-to-date):
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your task (replace `task-name` with the actual name of the task):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b task-name
   ```

   For example:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b homework-task1
   ```

### **Step 2: Work on Your Homework Task**
1. Open the relevant files in your code editor.
2. Implement the solution for the task assigned to you.
3. Test your solution to make sure it works correctly.

### **Step 3: Commit Your Solution**
Once youâ€™ve completed your task, commit your changes to the branch.

1. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Completed task 1: Implemented solution"
   ```

### **Step 4: Push Your Solution**
Now that you have committed your solution, push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin task-name
```

For example:
```bash
git push origin homework-task1
```

### **Step 5: Create a Pull Request**
1. Go to the GitHub repository page.
2. You will see a prompt to **Create a Pull Request** for your recently pushed branch. Click on **Compare & pull request**.
3. Add a descriptive title and comment about your changes.
4. Select **main** as the base branch and your `task-name` branch as the compare branch.
5. Click **Create pull request** to submit your solution.

### **Step 6: Review and Merge (Instructor's Task)**
The instructor will review your pull request and merge it into the `main` branch once it's approved.

---

## **Additional Notes**
- Always create a new branch for each task and do not push directly to the `main` branch.
- Keep your commits small and descriptive.
- Follow the correct naming convention for the branches and commit messages.
- Donâ€™t forget to pull the latest changes from `main` before you start your task to avoid merge conflicts.

That's it! Once youâ€™ve created a pull request, you're done. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
